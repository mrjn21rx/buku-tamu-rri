# Laravel Boost Guidelines

## Foundational Context

This application is a Laravel application running on PHP 8.3. Always use the APIs that match the installed major version of each package — do not assume a version.

Before relying on a package's API, confirm its installed version:
- PHP packages: run `composer show --direct` to list direct dependencies with versions, or `composer show <vendor/package>` for a single package.
- JS packages: check `package.json` for the installed versions.

## Conventions

- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, and naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Frontend Bundling

- If a frontend change doesn't show in the UI or you get a "Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, run `npm run build` or ask the user to run `npm run dev` or `composer run dev`.

## Artisan

- Run Artisan commands directly via the command line (e.g., `php artisan route:list`). Use `php artisan list` to discover available commands and `php artisan [command] --help` to check parameters.

## Tinker

- Execute PHP in app context for debugging and testing code. Always use single quotes to prevent shell expansion: `php artisan tinker --execute 'Your::code();'`

=== php rules ===

# PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even for single-line bodies.
- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion.
- Use explicit return type declarations and type hints for all method parameters.
- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over inline comments.
